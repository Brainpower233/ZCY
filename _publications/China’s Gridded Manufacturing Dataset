excerpt: 'Here, we propose a map point-of-interest classification method based on machine learning technology and build a dataset of the distribution of Chinese manufacturing firms called the Gridded Manufacturing Dataset. This dataset includes the number and type of manufacturing firms at a 0.01° latitude by 0.01° longitude scale. It includes all manufacturing firms (classified into seven categories) in China in 2015 (4.56 million) and 2019 (6.19 million). This dataset can be used to characterize temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution of manufacturing firms as well as reveal the mechanisms underlying the development of the manufacturing industry and changes in regional economic policies.'

The growth of the manufacturing industry is the engine of rapid economic growth in developing regions. Characterizing the geographical distribution of manufacturing firms is critically important for scientists and policymakers. However, data on the manufacturing industry used in previous studies either have a low spatial resolution (or fuzzy classification) or high-resolution information is lacking. Here, we propose a map point-of-interest classification method based on machine learning technology and build a dataset of the distribution of Chinese manufacturing firms called the Gridded Manufacturing Dataset. This dataset includes the number and type of manufacturing firms at a 0.01° latitude by 0.01° longitude scale. It includes all manufacturing firms (classified into seven categories) in China in 2015 (4.56 million) and 2019 (6.19 million). This dataset can be used to characterize temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution of manufacturing firms as well as reveal the mechanisms underlying the development of the manufacturing industry and changes in regional economic policies.
