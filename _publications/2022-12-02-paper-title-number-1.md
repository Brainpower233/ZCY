excerpt: 'Here, we propose a map point-of-interest classification method based on machine learning technology and build a dataset of the distribution of Chinese manufacturing firms called the Gridded Manufacturing Dataset. This dataset includes the number and type of manufacturing firms at a 0.01° latitude by 0.01° longitude scale. It includes all manufacturing firms (classified into seven categories) in China in 2015 (4.56 million) and 2019 (6.19 million). This dataset can be used to characterize temporal and spatial patterns in the distribution of manufacturing firms as well as reveal the mechanisms underlying the development of the manufacturing industry and changes in regional economic policies.'
