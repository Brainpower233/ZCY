Healthy street environment has received wide attention from multiple disciplines as an important part of healthy city development. In the context of urban renewal, records of sports tracking applications are used to study the correlation of built environmental elements in the core area of Beijing from the perspectives of individual and street. The characters of physical activities, environmental improvement methods, healthy street network optimization models are studied, and planning suggestions concerning cities at macro level, communities at intermediate level, and streets at micro level, are put forward.
