excerpt: 'Healthy street environment has received wide attention from multiple disciplines as an important part of healthy city development. In the context of urban renewal, records of sports tracking applications are used to study the correlation of built environmental elements in the core area of Beijing from the perspectives of individual and street. The characters of physical activities, environmental improvement methods, healthy street network optimization models are studied, and planning suggestions concerning cities at macro level, communities at intermediate level, and streets at micro level, are put forward.'

Exposure to green environments is crucial for human health. However, urbanization has reduced the contact of urban residents with natural environments, causing a mismatch between the supply and demand for green exposure. Research in this field is hindered by the lack of long-term, reliable data sources and methodologies, leading to insufficient consideration of temporal variations in green exposure. This study presented a comprehensive methodology for assessing green exposure at a fine scale utilizing satellite images for urban tree canopy identification. We conducted a case study in the core area of Beijing from 2010 to 2020 and examined the effects of urban renewal and alleviation efforts. The results revealed a slight decrease in green exposure for the elderly over the decade, with minimal changes in equity. In contrast, green exposure for children has increased, with increasing inequality. Moreover, urban renewal has improved green exposure for nearly half of the low-supply blocks. However, a significant mismatch was observed between supply and demand for blocks with increased demand but limited supply. This study enhances the assessment of green exposure and provides guidance for planning and constructing a “Green Equal City”.
